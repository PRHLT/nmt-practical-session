# Neural Machine Translation: a Practical Session
This repo contains a [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) notebook which presents a practical session to introduce the training of neural machine translation systems to students. It was created for the lab sessions of the *machine translation* module of the [IARFID](https://www.upv.es/titulaciones/MUIARFID/) master from [Universitat Politècnica de València](https://www.upv.es/en).

You can open the notebook by cliking on [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/PRHLT/nmt-practical-session/blob/master/nmt-practical-session.ipynb).

## Overview
The goal of this lab session is to build machine translation systems based on neural networks (neural machine translation; NMT) from a dataset of bilingual parallel sentences using a [custom version](https://github.com/PRHLT/OpenNMT-py/tree/lab_sessions) of the **OpenNMT-py** toolkit (Klein et al., 2017).

### Dataset

The dataset we are going to use in this practical session is the Spanish–English language pair of the **EuTrans** corpus (Casacuberta et al., 2004), whose content involves the interaction of a customer with a receptionist at the frontdesk of a hotel. It comes with the custom version of **OpenNMT-py** that we are using. It is located at *OpenNMT-py/dataset/EuTrans*.

Here we can see an example of its content:

> *por favor, ¿nos puede dar la llave de la habitación?*

> *can you give us the key to the room, please?*

### Network description

The neural network that we are going to use for training the NMT system has the following configuration:

* Encoder and decoder are both Transformer with 64 neurons.
* 2 layers.
* Hidden Transformer feed-forward of size 64.
* 2 self-attention heads.
* Source word vector of size 64.
* Target word vector of size 64.
